dc_entities
===========

This is an Android application that leverages your sensor position and geospatial data available from data.dc.gov.

Basic shapefiles showing registered parks, bars, restaurants, etc. ("entities") are ingested to a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, and made available to this Android application by GeoJSON served up either through the geospatialJSON web application dc_entities_web as hosted in this repository, or by an instance of OpenGeo Server configured against the database.
